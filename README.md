# Cryptography Algorithms Implementation

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental cryptography techniques using Python. It includes symmetric encryption (AES), asymmetric encryption (RSA), and hashing (SHA-256). The project is designed to show how data can be secured using encryption and how data integrity can be verified using hashing.

## Project Objective
- Understand basic cryptography concepts  
- Implement AES symmetric encryption  
- Implement RSA asymmetric encryption  
- Implement SHA-256 hashing and verification  
- Build interactive command-line security tools

## Cryptography Concepts Covered

### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
Symmetric encryption algorithm where the same key is used for encryption and decryption.

Used in:
- File encryption  
- VPN security  
- Disk encryption  

---

### RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
Asymmetric encryption algorithm using public and private keys.

Used in:
- Secure communication  
- Digital certificates  
- HTTPS  

---

### SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)
Hashing algorithm that converts data into fixed-length hash output.

Used in:
- Password storage  
- Data integrity verification  
- Blockchain
